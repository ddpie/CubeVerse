# CubeVerse - Cube World

| English | [中文](README_CN.md) |
|:---:|:---:|

## Project Overview

CubeVerse is a 3D cube world game developed using AI-assisted development tools (such as Kiro) through natural language conversations.

> **Note**: Amazon Q Developer CLI has been renamed to Kiro CLI. This project was originally developed using Amazon Q Developer CLI, and we now recommend using Kiro or Kiro CLI for continued development.

## Innovative Development Approach

Traditional game development has high technical barriers, where game producers, designers, and other non-technical team members can only describe their creative ideas through documentation without directly participating in implementation. This development model leads to slow conversion of ideas into actual features and often results in misunderstandings.

By combining **AI-assisted development tools** with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** technology and Unity integration, we've created a new paradigm of natural language-driven game development. Developers only need to describe requirements in natural language, and AI assistants intelligently interpret instructions, automatically generate code, and directly control the game engine to implement features, achieving seamless transformation from ideas to functionality.

This project is built from scratch using Kiro and other AI development tools, including all code and engine configurations, representing a complete practice of this innovative development approach.

This solution lowers the barrier to game programming skills, enabling every team member (including non-technical personnel) to directly participate in feature development, greatly improving iteration speed and creative validation efficiency. It is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping, concept validation, and agile iteration scenarios in game studios.
