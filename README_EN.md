# CubeVerse - Cube World

| üá∫English | [üá®‰∏≠Êñá](README.md) |
|:---:|:---:|

## Project Overview

CubeVerse is a 3D cube world game developed entirely using **Amazon Q Developer CLI** through natural language conversations.

## Innovative Development Approach

Traditional game development has high technical barriers, where game producers, designers, and other non-technical team members can only describe their creative ideas through documentation without directly participating in implementation. This development model leads to slow conversion of ideas into actual features and often results in misunderstandings.

**Amazon Q Developer CLI** innovatively combines **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** technology with Unity integration, creating a new paradigm of natural language-driven game development. Developers only need to describe requirements in natural language, and Q CLI intelligently interprets instructions, automatically generates code, and directly controls the game engine to implement features, achieving seamless transformation from ideas to functionality.

This project is built entirely from scratch using Amazon Q Developer CLI, including all code and engine configurations, representing a complete practice of this innovative development approach.

This solution significantly lowers the barrier to game programming skills, enabling every team member (including non-technical personnel) to directly participate in feature development, greatly improving iteration speed and creative validation efficiency. It is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping, concept validation, and agile iteration scenarios in game studios, bringing revolutionary changes to the game development process.

## Demo Video

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bUKfzjEbr

### Video Description

This demo video showcases how to use Amazon Q Developer CLI to develop games through natural language conversations with Unity. In the video, we achieve the following effects through simple natural language commands:

- Switch the game scene to winter style and enable snow effects
- Adjust terrain generation parameters to reduce terrain undulation

All these operations are completed through conversations with Amazon Q Developer CLI, rather than manually modifying code or adjusting parameters.

## Game Features

## Development Tools

### Amazon Q Developer CLI + MCP Unity - Core Development Tools
This project is **100% developed using Amazon Q Developer CLI** combined with **MCP Unity** through natural language conversations:

#### MCP Unity Integration
- **Project Repository**: [https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity](https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity)
- **MCP Protocol**: Model Context Protocol, enabling direct AI interaction with Unity
- **Seamless Integration**: Amazon Q Developer CLI directly operates Unity Editor through MCP
- **Real-time Operations**: AI can directly create and modify game objects and components without manual intervention

#### Development Features
- **Natural Language Programming**: All code generated through AI conversations without manual coding
- **Intelligent Code Generation**: Complex weather systems and physics interactions entirely generated by AI understanding requirements
- **Real-time Problem Solving**: All technical issues encountered during development resolved through natural language descriptions
- **Code Optimization Suggestions**: AI proactively provides performance optimization and code improvement suggestions
- **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Project documentation and code comments entirely generated by AI
- **Direct Engine Operations**: Through MCP protocol, AI can directly create scenes, add components, and set parameters in Unity

### Development Environment
- **Game Engine**: Unity 2022.3 LTS
- **Programming Language**: C# (generated through natural language)
- **Core Tool**: Amazon Q Developer CLI

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or higher
- Amazon Q Developer CLI (core development tool)
- Node.js 18+ (for running MCP Unity server)

### MCP Installation Steps
Refer to https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity/blob/main/README.md for MCP configuration

### Project Setup Steps
1. Open the project using Unity Hub
2. Wait for Unity to import all assets
3. In the Project window, navigate to the `Assets/Scenes` folder
4. Double-click to open the `SampleScene.scene` file
5. Click the play button at the top of the editor to start the game

### Controls
- **WASD** - Movement
- **Mouse** - Camera control
- **Space** - Jump

## Recommended Development Process

For developing complex game projects using Amazon Q Developer CLI, we recommend the following structured process:

1. **Rough Idea** - Establish the basic concept and core gameplay (provided by humans)
2. **CodeBase Research** - Understand relevant technologies and existing solutions (done by Q CLI, monitored by humans)
3. **Requirement Clarification** - Refine and clarify requirements through Q CLI questioning (Q CLI asks questions, humans answer)
4. **Detail Design** - Design system architecture, component interactions, and data flow (done by Q CLI, monitored by humans)
5. **Implementation Plan** - Create task lists and development roadmap (done by Q CLI, monitored by humans)
6. **Implementation** - Implement features through natural language instructions (done by Q CLI, monitored by humans)

This process is based on [This PR](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli/pull/834) and is particularly suitable for team collaboration and complex feature development. Through this approach, even non-technical team members can participate in the entire development process, from conceptualization to final implementation.
