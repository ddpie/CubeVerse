# CubeVerse - Cube World

English | [‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

## Project Overview

CubeVerse is a 3D cube world game developed entirely using **Amazon Q Developer CLI** through natural language conversations. Built on Unity 2022.3 LTS, this project demonstrates how to rapidly build a feature-rich game world through natural language interactions with AI assistants, without manually writing code.

### Video Description

This demo video showcases how to use Amazon Q Developer CLI to control the game in real-time through natural language conversations. In the video, we achieve the following effects through simple natural language commands:

- Switch the game scene to winter style and enable snow effects
- Adjust terrain generation parameters to reduce terrain undulation

All these operations are completed through conversations with Amazon Q Developer CLI, rather than manually modifying code or adjusting parameters.

## Game Features

### üéÆ Core Gameplay
- **First-Person Perspective Control**: Smooth player movement and camera control
- **Cube World Generation**: Procedurally generated cube terrain
- **Physics Interaction**: Realistic physics collision and gravity system

### üå¶Ô∏è Weather System
- **Rain System**: Realistic rainfall effects with rain particle effects and sounds
- **Snow System**: Beautiful snowfall effects creating winter atmosphere
- **Lightning System**: Dynamic lightning effects enhancing storm experience
- **Rainbow System**: Post-rain rainbows adding visual beauty
- **Cloud System**: Dynamic cloud generation and movement

### üåÖ Day-Night Cycle
- **Day-Night Transition**: Smooth day-night transition effects
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Environmental lighting that changes with time
- **Star System**: Starry sky effects during nighttime

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization

## Development Tools

### Amazon Q Developer CLI + MCP Unity - Core Development Tools
This project is **100% developed using Amazon Q Developer CLI** combined with **MCP Unity** through natural language conversations:

#### MCP Unity Integration
- **Project Repository**: [https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity](https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity)
- **MCP Protocol**: Model Context Protocol, enabling direct AI interaction with Unity
- **Seamless Integration**: Amazon Q Developer CLI directly operates Unity Editor through MCP
- **Real-time Operations**: AI can directly create and modify game objects and components without manual intervention

#### Development Features
- **Natural Language Programming**: All code generated through AI conversations without manual coding
- **Intelligent Code Generation**: Complex weather systems and physics interactions entirely generated by AI understanding requirements
- **Real-time Problem Solving**: All technical issues encountered during development resolved through natural language descriptions
- **Code Optimization Suggestions**: AI proactively provides performance optimization and code improvement suggestions
- **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Project documentation and code comments entirely generated by AI
- **Direct Engine Operations**: Through MCP protocol, AI can directly create scenes, add components, and set parameters in Unity

### Development Environment
- **Game Engine**: Unity 2022.3 LTS
- **Programming Language**: C# (generated through natural language)
- **Core Tool**: Amazon Q Developer CLI

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or higher
- Amazon Q Developer CLI (core development tool)
